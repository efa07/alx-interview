# Pascal's Triangle

## Description
This repository contains an implementation of Pascal's Triangle in Python. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. It has various applications in mathematics and computer science.

## Contents
- `pascal_triangle.py`: Python script that generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows.
- `test_pascal_triangle.py`: Unit tests for the `pascal_triangle.py` script.

## Usage
To generate Pascal's Triangle, simply run the `pascal_triangle.py` script and provide the number of rows as a command-line argument. For example:

```
$ python pascal_triangle.py 5
```

This will generate Pascal's Triangle with 5 rows and display the result.
