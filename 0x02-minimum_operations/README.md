# Minimum Operations

This repository contains the solution for the "Minimum Operations" coding challenge.

## Problem Description

Given a string `s`, the goal is to transform it into a target string `t` using the minimum number of operations. The available operations are:

1. Copy the entire string.
2. Paste the copied string.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We start with an empty string and keep appending characters from `s` until we reach a point where we can copy and paste the existing string to match `t`. We repeat this process until `s` is transformed into `t`.

## Implementation

The solution is implemented in Python. The main function `minimum_operations(s: str, t: str) -> int` takes two strings `s` and `t` as input and returns the minimum number of operations required to transform `s` into `t`.

## Usage

To use the solution, simply call the `minimum_operations` function with the desired input strings:

```python
s = "abc"
t = "ababab"
result = minimum_operations(s, t)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the target string `t`. This is because we iterate through `t` only once. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.
