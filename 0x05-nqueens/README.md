# N Queens Problem Solver

This Python program solves the N queens problem, which is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard.

## Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

```bash
./nqueens.py N
```
where N is the size of the chessboard (N×N) and the number of queens to be placed. N must be an integer greater than or equal to 4

## Example
```
$ ./nqueens.py 4
[[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 2]]
[[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 1]]
```
