# README

This is the README file for the `0x08-making_change` project.

## Description

The `0x08-making_change` project is a coding exercise that focuses on implementing an algorithm to make change using the fewest number of coins.

## Files

- `make_change.py`: Contains the implementation of the `make_change` function.

## Usage

To use the `make_change` function, import it into your Python script and call it with the desired amount of change.

```python
from make_change import make_change

amount = 42
result = make_change(amount)
print(result)
```
